Howdy, friends!

I’ve come up with a little list of tips for you to use while you start your exercise voyage. I know I definitely struggled with these things when I first began, so if you’re feeling the same way, just know you’re not alone and I’m excited to help you! If you’re not new to exercise but just want to see what this post is all about, try to keep these things in mind as you continue to workout or prepare to start a new routine! Let’s go.
<div className="FitnessHealthSubTitle">
1. Make small, digestible goals and then build on them.
</div>
It’s important to not overwhelm yourself in the beginning to avoid things like overexhaustion, burnout, and injury. Try to fast walk, then jog, then run. Try squats without weights, then add weight, then move into weighted squat-kicks. Try to workout twice a week, then three times, then four. Small steps create milestones.

2. Be realistic about your schedule and how often you can exercise.
</div>
If you know you can workout on Monday and Thursday nights, but your schedule is hectic for the rest of the week, focus on working out on just those two days. It’s more important to make exercise a habit and commit to working out a couple days a week than to overload yourself and potentially give up in the end. When you don’t have a lot of time, you can workout in small increments throughout the day, even if it’s just for 10 minutes. Make it a goal to to squeeze in more time as you continue to exercise. It’s okay to move slow, as long as you’re moving!

3. Get creative with how you’re going to do your cardio and strength training.
</div>
Maybe you want to dance around your house non-stop for an hour instead of jogging. Maybe you want to take a HIIT class instead of doing your usual at-home resistance routine. Maybe your friend is moving and needs your help, so you’ll count that work towards your workout! Try lots of things because there isn’t just one way to exercise, and don’t believe anyone who tells you there is.

4. Start caring about your water intake.
</div>
Your body needs water to function, and it especially needs water to function while working out. Download apps like Plant Nanny, Waterlogged. and Gulp to track your water intake.
<div className="FitnessHealthSubTitle">
5. Find a workout buddy!
</div>
They can be your best friend, co-worker, mom, coach, personal trainer, or whoever else you want to workout with. Exercising with someone else can help you push yourself further, skip the gym less, try new workouts, and spice up your regular workout routine. Just be sure that the person you choose has similar goals in mind and will hold you accountable. There’s nothing worse than having a friend talk you out of working out instead of into!

6. Avoid crash diets
</div>
Avoid them like the plague. Please, for the love of all that is good and true, do not crash diet. I know it’s tempting, but I have seen so many people do it and it never works. You’ll starve your body of nutrients to lose a few lbs but only until you realize the diet isn’t attainable and the weight comes right back. Crash dieting can actually destroy your metabolism, which will screw you over in the long run. My advice: talk to a dietitian. Not a nutritionist (that’s a topic for later) but a registered dietitian. They can help create a diet plan for you, but if a dietitian isn’t exactly in the budget, you can go to websites like choosemyplate.gov to help you make healthier choices.

I hope this helps you guys! I’ve learned all of these things from personal experience, and you’ll figure out what works best for you as you go. Remember that these tips aren’t set in stone either, and if you have any tips from your own experiences, please comment below! I’d love to hear what helps you. 

Talk to you next week!
